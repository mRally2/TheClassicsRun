   <p><strong>KNOWN ISSUES</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <ul>
      <li>The replacement of the string "PRESS ENTER (TO BEGIN)" works only if you launch the game with keyboard controls</li>
      <li>Some customization parts might not look right due to the default position set for the original vehicles they were meant for</li>
      <li>Some events might not be possible to complete if chosen a lower-performance vehicle and the AI was given very high-performance ones or if you went to the gas station for a hot-swap</li>
      <li>Cannot enter individual stages using the front end menu since the garage will appear as empty</li>
      <li>If a vehicle is not customized then it might’ve been Cheat Engine omitting its particular script. Restart both, the game and the trainer</li>
      <li>Because of how Cheat Engine trainers work, if you close its window you will still have all scripts that got enabled in the first place. In order to disable them all, you must do it manually by killing all instances of the trainer in the Task Manager<br></li>
   </ul>
   <p><br></p>
   <p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
   <hr>
   <ul>
      <li>The recommended difficulty to be played on is HARD. If chosen EXTREME, some races become unbeatable. You have been warned.</li>
      <li>This take of the game is thought of as an alternative to the original story mode. If you have never played it before then I suggest you do that first since the speed and complexity you are facing in this version might discourage you to continue playing</li>
      <li>Your antivirus might detect it as a threat. It’s a false positive. The tool has been built using a custom compiled version of Cheat Engine 7.3</li>
      <li>I am not responsible for any damage caused to your system by this tool so use it at your own risk</li>
      <li>I do not own the rights of the art shown on the cover and thumbnail of this product. It’s a fan art for illustrating the purpose of the product itself. All rights reserved to Electronic Arts Inc.</li>
